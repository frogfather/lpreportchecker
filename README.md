This was written for a previous job I did where checking of an excel spreadsheet was carried out manually. 
While very specific to the task (it was written in a great hurry) there are some techniques involving the
use of unmanaged code (i.e. getting this application to open, read and, most importantly close and free the
excel spreadsheet) which may be of use to others.
